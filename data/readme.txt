In terms of the OntoNotes English dataset:
    This is the standard train/dev/test split

    train dev are taken from the conll2012-processed
    test is taken from the pradhan-processed

    train: 1,088,503 tokens, 81,828 entities
    dev: 147,724 tokens, 11,066 entities
    test: 152,728 tokens, 11,257 entities

    The thing that we did this is because of fair comparison with previous work.
